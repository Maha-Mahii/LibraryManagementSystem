# Library-Management-System !## Introduction 
A Library Management System designed to see the books available in a college library. It allows students to register as a user and issue/return books from the college library hassle free. The backend is designed as a **Monolithic Architecture** with various nuances as discussed below.
## Technologies and Dependencies Used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) used as a dependency management tool.
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) used to build hassle free web applications and writing REST APIs.
* [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) used for Authentication and Authorizations.
* [Spring data JPA (Hibernate)](https://hibernate.org/) Used to reduce the time of writing hardcoded sql queries and instead allows to write much more readable and scalable code 
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) used as a Java persistence store
* [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) Reduces the time  of writing java boiler plate code.
